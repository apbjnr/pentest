# Kerberoast

* offline cracking of service account passwords
* the kerberos session ticket (TSG) has a server portion which is encrypted with the password hash of service account. this makes it possible to request a ticket and do offline password attack
* service accounts are usually ignored (passwords rarely changed) and have privileged access.
* password hashes of service accounts could be used to create silver tickets.


* finding user accounts used as service accounts
  * powerview
```powershell
Get-NetUser -SPN
```

  * AD module
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName
