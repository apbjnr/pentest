# Kerberoast

* offline cracking of service account passwords
* the kerberos session ticket (TSG) has a server portion which is encrypted with the password hash of service account. this makes it possible to request a ticket and do offline password attack
* service accounts are usually ignored (passwords rarely changed) and have privileged access.
* password hashes of service accounts could be used to create silver tickets.
