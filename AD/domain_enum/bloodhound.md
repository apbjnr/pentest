# Domain Enumeration - BloodHound

* provides gui for AD entities and relationships for the data collected by its ingestors
* uses graph theory for providing the capability of mapping the shortest path for interesting things like domain admins
* built-in queries for frequently used actions
* supports custom cipher queries
* https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound

* supply data to bloodhound
```powershell
C:\tools\BloodHound-master\Ingestors\SharpHound.ps1

Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All
```

* the generated archive can be uploaded to the bloodhound application (gui)
* to avoid detections like ATA
```powershell
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -ExcludeDC
```

note: the .exe ingestor is a lot faster than the powershell ingestor script.
