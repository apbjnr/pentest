### multiple varients of the same word


you have a hash to crack, and you know the word / phrase that is used in the password, but it might have special characters, upper / lower case or numbers in it but you dont know where. You can use a custom rule or a rule included in hashcat to generate a wordlist of varients of the word or phrase.

```bash
/usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
/usr/share/hashcat/rules/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule - https://github.com/stealthsploit/Optimised-hashcat-Rule.git
```

```bash
## write the word you want various forms from into a file
┌──(apb㉿sigh)-[/tmp]
└─$ echo sigh! > rule                                                                                                                       130 ⨯
                                                                                                                                                             
┌──(apb㉿sigh)-[/tmp]
└─$ cat rule
sigh!

## now we will use the above phrase and a hashcat rule to create various forms of the above phrase and try to crack the hash with that.
