### rinetd


```bash
root@kali:~# cat /etc/rinetd.conf
#
# this is the configuration file for rinetd, the internet redirection server
#
# you may specify global allow and deny rules here
# only ip addresses are matched, hostnames cannot be specified here
# the wildcards you may use are * and ?
#
# allow 192.168.2.*
# deny 192.168.2.1?


#
# forwarding rules come here
#
# you may specify allow and deny rules after a specific forwarding rule
# to apply to only that forwarding rule
#
# bindadress    bindport  connectaddress  connectport


# logging information
logfile /var/log/rinetd.log

# uncomment the following line if you want web-server style logfile format
# logcommon

Example:
# bindadress    bindport  connectaddress  connectport
IP  		port 	  remote IP       remote port
```

So redirect all incoming traffic to the local IP on the local port to the Remote IP and Remote Port.
