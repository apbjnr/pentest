## subverting application logic

application allows you to login with a username and password. the application will query the database with the following query. 
username: apb
password: sigh

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'apb' AND password = 'sigh'
```

if the query returns the details of the user, then the login is successful, otherwise it is rejected.

it is possible to log in as any user without using a password by using a sql comment sequence (--).  the -- will remove the password check from the where clause in the query. 

example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password into the login form on the web app.

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
```
the query will return the user using the username administrator and log them in as that user.
